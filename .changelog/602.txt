```release-note:note
tfsdk: The `Config`, `Plan`, and `State` type `PathMatches()` method logic previously returned `Invalid Path Expression for Schema Data` errors based on implementation details of the underlying data, which prevented returning zero matches in cases where the expression is valid for the schema, but there was no actual data at the path. Providers can now determine whether zero matches is consequential for their use case. 
```

```release-note:bug
tfsdk: Fixed false positive `Invalid Path Expression for Schema Data` error to be schema-determined instead of data-determined
```

```release-note:bug
types/basetypes: Fixed `ObjectType` type `ApplyTerraform5AttributePathStep` method to return an error instead of `nil` for invalid attribute name steps
```
