  How to use timeouts with the provider development framework.

# Timeouts

The reality of cloud infrastructure is that it typically takes time to perform operations such as booting operating systems, discovering services, and replicating state across network edges. As the provider developer you should take known delays in resource APIs into account in the CRUD functions of the resource. Terraform supports configurable timeouts to assist in these situations.

The Framework can be used in conjunction with the [terraform-plugin-framework-timeouts](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-timeouts) module in order to allow defining timeouts in configuration and have them be available in CRUD functions.

## Specifying Timeouts in Configuration

Timeouts can be specified using nested attributes if [protocol version 6](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/how-terraform-works#protocol-version-6) is being used.

Refer to [nested block](../migrating/resources/timeouts#nested-block) if you are migrating timeouts from SDKv2 to the Framework.

```terraform
resource "timeouts_example" "example" {
  /* ... */

  timeouts = {
    create = "60m"
  }
}
```

The Schema is modified by calling `timeouts.Attributes` supplying options to specify which attributes are to be added.

```go
func (e *exampleResource) GetSchema(ctx context.Context) (tfsdk.Schema, diag.Diagnostics) {
    return tfsdk.Schema{
        Attributes: map[string]tfsdk.Attribute{
            /* ... */
            "timeouts": timeouts.Attributes(ctx, timeouts.Opts{
                Create: true,
            }),
        },
```

## Updating Models

In functions in which the config, state or plan is being unmarshalled, for instance, the `Create` function, the model
will need to be updated.

```go
func (e *exampleResource) Create(ctx context.Context, req resource.CreateRequest, resp *resource.CreateResponse) {
	var data exampleResourceData

	diags := req.Plan.Get(ctx, &data)
	resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)
```

The `exampleResourceData` model needs to be modified to include a field for timeouts, which is `types.Object`.

```go
type exampleResourceData struct {
    /* ... */
    Timeouts    types.Object `tfsdk:"timeouts"`
```

## Accessing Timeouts in CRUD Functions

Once the model has been populated with the config, state or plan the duration of the timeout can be accessed by calling
the appropriate helper function and then used to configure timeout behaviour, for instance:

```go
func (e *exampleResource) Create(ctx context.Context, req resource.CreateRequest, resp *resource.CreateResponse) {
    var data exampleResourceData

    diags := req.Plan.Get(ctx, &data)
    resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)
    if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
        return
    }

    defaultCreateTimeout := 20 * time.Minute

    createTimeout := timeouts.Create(ctx, data.Timeouts, defaultCreateTimeout)

    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, createTimeout)
    defer cancel()

    /* ... */
}
```
