# Provider-defined functions

Functions are an abstraction that allow providers to expose computational logic beyond Terraform's [built-in functions](/terraform/language/functions) and simplify practitioner configurations. Provider-defined functions are supported in Terraform 1.8 and later.

<Note>

It is possible to add functions to an existing provider. If you do not have an existing provider, you will need to create your own provider to contain the functions. Please see [Getting Started - Code Walkthrough](/terraform/plugin/framework/getting-started/code-walkthrough) to learn how to create your first provider.

## Concepts

Learn about Terraform's [concepts](/terraform/plugin/framework/functions/concepts) for provider-defined functions, such as intended purpose, example use cases, and terminology. The framework's implementation details, such as naming, are based on these concepts.

## Implementation

Learn about how to [implement code](/terraform/plugin/framework/functions/implementation) for a provider-defined function in the framework.

## Testing

Learn about how to ensure a provider-defined function implementation works as expected via [unit testing and acceptance testing](/terraform/plugin/framework/functions/testing).

## Documentation

Learn about how to [document](/terraform/plugin/framework/functions/documentation) a provider-defined function implementation so practitioners can discover and use the function.
