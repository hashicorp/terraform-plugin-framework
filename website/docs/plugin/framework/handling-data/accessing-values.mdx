# Access state, configuration, and plan data

There are various points at which the provider needs access to the data from
the practitioner's configuration, Terraform's state, or generated plan.
The same patterns are used for accessing this data, regardless of
its source.

The data is usually stored in a request object:

```go
func (r ThingResource) Create(ctx context.Context,
	req resource.CreateRequest, resp *resource.CreateResponse)
```

In this example, `req` holds the configuration and plan, and there is no state
value because the resource does not yet exist in state.

## Get the Entire Configuration, Plan, or State

One way to interact with configuration, plan, and state values is to convert
the entire configuration, plan, or state into a Go type, then treat them as
regular Go values. This has the benefit of letting the compiler check all your
code that accesses values, but requires defining a type to contain the values.

Use the `Get` method to retrieve the first level of configuration, plan, and state data.

```go
type ThingResourceModel struct {
	Address    types.Object `tfsdk:"address"`
	Age        types.Int64  `tfsdk:"age"`
	Name       types.String `tfsdk:"name"`
	Pets       types.List   `tfsdk:"pets"`
	Registered types.Bool   `tfsdk:"registered"`
	Tags       types.Map    `tfsdk:"tags"`
}

func (r ThingResource) Create(ctx context.Context,
	req resource.CreateRequest, resp *resource.CreateResponse) {
	var plan ThingResourceModel

	diags := req.Plan.Get(ctx, &plan)

	resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)

	if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
		return
	}

	// values can now be accessed like plan.Name.ValueString()
	// check if things are null with plan.Name.IsNull()
	// check if things are unknown with plan.Name.IsUnknown()
}
```

The configuration, plan, and state data is represented as an object, and
accessed like an object. Refer to the [object type](/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/types/object) documentation for an
explanation on how objects can be converted into Go types.

To descend into deeper nested data structures, the `types.List`, `types.Map`, and `types.Set` types each have an `ElementsAs()` method. The `types.Object` type has an `As()` method.

## Get a Single Attribute or Block Value

Use the `GetAttribute` method to retrieve a top level attribute or block value from the configuration, plan, and state.

```go
func (r ThingResource) Read(ctx context.Context,
	req resource.ReadRequest, resp *resource.ReadResponse) {
	var name types.String

	diags := req.State.GetAttribute(ctx, path.Root("name"), &name)

	resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)

	if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
		return
	}

	// ...
}
```

## When Can a Value Be Unknown or Null?

A lot of conversion rules say an error will be returned if a value is unknown
or null. It is safe to assume:

* Required attributes will never be null or unknown in Create, Read, Update, or
  Delete methods.
* Optional attributes that are not computed will never be unknown in Create,
  Read, Update, or Delete methods.
* Computed attributes, whether optional or not, will never be null in the plan
  for Create, Read, Update, or Delete methods.
* Computed attributes that are read-only (`Optional` is not `true`) will always
  be unknown in the plan for Create, Read, Update, or Delete methods. They will
  always be null in the configuration for Create, Read, Update, and Delete
  methods.
* Required attributes will never be null in a provider's Configure method. They
  may be unknown.
* The state never contains unknown values.
* The configuration for Create, Read, Update, and Delete methods never contains
  unknown values.

In any other circumstances, the provider is responsible for handling the
possibility that an unknown or null value may be presented to it.
