## 1.15.0-beta.1 (April 15, 2025)

NOTES:

* This beta pre-release continues the implementation of managed resource identity, which should now be used with Terraform v1.12.0-beta1. Managed resources now can support import by identity during plan and apply workflows. Managed resources that already support import via the `resource.ResourceWithImportState` interface will automatically pass-through identity data to the `Read` method. The `RequiredForImport` and `OptionalForImport` fields on the identity schema can be used to control the validation that Terraform core will apply to the import config block.
