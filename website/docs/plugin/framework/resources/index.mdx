# Resources

[Resources](/language/resources) are an abstraction that allow Terraform to manage infrastructure objects, such as a compute instance, an access policy, or disk. Terraform assumes that every resource:

- operates as a pure key/value store, with values getting returned exactly as they were written.
- needs only one API call to update or return its state.
- can be be created, read, updated, and deleted.

Providers act as a translation layer between Terraform and an API, offering one or more resources for practitioners to define in a configuration. To create resources for your provider, you need to define both the resource archetype and actions on specific resource instances.

## Define Resource Archetype

Implement the [`tfsdk.ResourceType`
interface](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#ResourceType) for every type of
resource you want to support: compute instances, disks, access policies, etc. It
allows you to describe the resource archetype, which is the functionality related to all instances of that resource type in the configuration, state, plan, and API. `ResourceType` has the following methods:

### GetSchema

`GetSchema` returns a [schema](/plugin/framework/schemas) describing what fields are available in the resource's configuration and state.

### NewResource

`NewResource` returns a new instance of that resource type. It instantiates a new [`tfsdk.Resource` implementation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#Resource)
that expects to operate on data with the structure defined in `GetSchema`. It does not need to create the instance on the API.

The `NewResource` method is passed a [`tfsdk.Provider` implementation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#Provider).
This is the [provider type](/plugin/framework/providers) after its
`Configure` method was called. The `NewResource` method can type-assert on this
and inject it into the `Resource`, allowing the `Resource` to have
strongly-typed access to the configured API client or other provider
configuration data.

<br />
**Example**

```go
type computeInstanceResourceType struct{}

func (c computeInstanceResourceType) GetSchema(_ context.Context) (tfsdk.Schema,
	diag.Diagnostics) {
	return tfsdk.Schema{
		Attributes: map[string]tfsdk.Attribute{
			"name": {
				Type: types.StringType,
				Required: true,
			},
		},
	}, nil
}

func (c computeInstanceResourceType) NewResource(_ context.Context,
	p tfsdk.Provider) (tfsdk.Resource, diag.Diagnostics) {
	return computeInstanceResource{
		client: p.(*provider).client,
	}, nil
}
```

## Define Resources

Resources are scoped to a single instance of a resource type. They modify a specific resource in the API and in the state, given that resource's configuration, state, and plan values. They do this through the following methods.

### Create

`Create` makes the necessary API calls to create the resource and then persist that resource's data into the Terraform state. This is usually accomplished by:

1. [Reading the plan data](/plugin/framework/accessing-values) from the [`tfsdk.CreateResourceRequest`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#CreateResourceRequest)
1. Using the configured API client injected into the resource by the resource type's `NewResource` method
1. [Writing to the state](/plugin/framework/writing-state).

It is very important that every known value in the plan ends up in state as a
byte-for-byte match, or Terraform will throw errors. The plan is the provider's
contract with Terraform: the provider can only change values that are
[unknown](/plugin/framework/types#unknown) in the plan. It's also
very important that every unknown value in the plan gets a known, concrete
value when it's set in the state; the state can never hold any unknown values.

### Read

`Read` updates Terraform's state to reflect the latest state of the resource in the API.

There is no plan or config to work with in `Read`. Resources should [retrieve the data they need](/plugin/framework/accessing-values) from the current state included in the [`tfsdk.ReadResourceRequest`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#ReadResourceRequest). They can then use the configured API client injected into the resource by the
resource type's `NewResource` method, and [write the results to the
state](/plugin/framework/writing-state).

The provider can set any value in state, but you should be mindful of values that:

- represent "drift," or instances when the API's state has
  deviated from the source of truth defined in the configuration file. This is
  usually (but not always) the result of someone or something other than
  Terraform modifying a resource Terraform "owns". When this happens, the value
  should always be updated in state to reflect the drifted value.
- are semantically equivalent with values
  currently in state. Some values are semantically the same even if they are not a byte-for-byte match. JSON strings that change the order of keys or change the
  semantically-insignificant whitespace, for example, may not represent drift but
  are just different representations of the same value. When this happens, the
  _existing_ value should always be maintained in state and should not be
  replaced with the new representation that the API is returning.

### Update

`Update` makes the necessary API calls to modify the existing resource to match the configuration and then to persist that resource's data into the Terraform state. This is usually accomplished by:

1. [Reading the plan data](/plugin/framework/accessing-values) from the [`tfsdk.UpdateResourceRequest`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#UpdateResourceRequest)
1. Using the configured API client injected into the resource by the resource
   type's `NewResource` method
1. [Writing to the state](/plugin/framework/writing-state).

It is very important that every known value in the plan ends up in state as a
byte-for-byte match, or Terraform will throw errors. The plan is the provider's
contract with Terraform: the provider can only change values that are
[unknown](/plugin/framework/types#unknown) in the plan. It's also
very important that every unknown value in the plan gets a known, concrete
value when it's set in the state; the state can never hold any unknown values.

### Delete

`Delete` makes the necessary API calls to destroy a resource and then to remove that resource from the Terraform state. This is usually accomplished by:

1. [Reading the prior state data](/plugin/framework/accessing-values) from the
   [`tfsdk.DeleteResourceRequest`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#DeleteResourceRequest)
1. Using the configured API client injected into the resource by the resource
   type's `NewResource` method

### ImportState

`ImportState` is an optional method that implements resource [import](/cli/import). This functionality creates an initial Terraform state to bring the resource under management via the [`terraform import` command](/cli/commands/import). This method must provide enough state for the resource to be successfully refreshed via the `Read` method. This is usually accomplished by:

1. Using the import identifier from the [`tfsdk.ImportResourceStateRequest`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#ImportResourceStateRequest) to [set state data](/plugin/framework/writing-state) in the
   [`tfsdk.ImportResourceStateResponse`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#ImportResourceStateResponse).

The [`tfsdk.ResourceImportStatePassthroughID` function](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#ResourceImportStatePassthroughID) is available to simplify writing the import identifier to an attribute.

Refer to [Resource Import](/plugin/framework/resources/import) for more details and code examples.

### UpgradeState

`UpgradeState` is an optional method that implements resource [state](/language/state) upgrades when there are breaking changes to the [schema](/plugin/framework/schemas).

Refer to [State Upgrades](/plugin/framework/resources/state-upgrade) for more details and code examples.

## Add Resource to Provider

To make new resources available to practitioners, add them to the `GetResources` method on the [provider](/plugin/framework/providers).
The key must be the name of the resource, including the provider prefix, and
the value must be an instance of the resource type.

**Example**

```go
func (p *provider) GetResources(_ context.Context) (map[string]tfsdk.ResourceType,
	diag.Diagnostics) {
	return map[string]tfsdk.ResourceType{
		"example_compute_instance": computeInstanceResourceType{},
	}, nil
}
```

## Further Resource Capabilities

- [Plan modification](/plugin/framework/resources/plan-modification) helps practitioners understand expected behaviors for your resource during changes, such as default values for missing configurations or requiring replacement.
- [Validation](/plugin/framework/validation) helps practitioners understand the required syntax, types, and acceptable values for your resource.
