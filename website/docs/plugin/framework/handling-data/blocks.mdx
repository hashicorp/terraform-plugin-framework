# Blocks

The Terraform language uses a block as a container for other attributes and blocks. Terraform implements many top level blocks, such as `provider` and `resource`, while providers can implement nested blocks in their schema to enable practitioners to configure data.

-> Use [nested attributes](/plugin/framework/handling-data/terraform-concepts#nested-attributes) for new schema implementations. Block support is mainly for migrating prior SDK-based providers.

In this example, the Terraform-defined `resource` block contains a provider-defined `ami` attribute and `network_interface` block.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "abc123"

  network_interface {
    # ...
  }
}
```

The configuration syntax for a provider-defined block is a type (block name) and the body is delimited by the `{` and `}` characters. Each block has an associated nesting mode, which declares whether a block is repeatable. The available nesting modes are:

- List: Ordered collection of objects
- Set: Unordered collection of objects
- Single: One object

For list and set blocks, configurations can implement [`dynamic` block expressions](/language/expressions/dynamic-blocks) to reduce hardcoded block values.

Refer to [nested blocks](/plugin/framework/handling-data/terraform-concepts#nested-blocks) for implementation examples in framework code.
