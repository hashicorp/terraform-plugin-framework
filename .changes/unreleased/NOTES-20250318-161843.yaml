kind: NOTES
body: This alpha pre-release contains an initial implementation for managed resource identity, which can used with Terraform v1.12.0-alpha20250312,
    to store and read identity data during plan and apply workflows. A managed resource identity can be used by implementing the
    optional `resource.ResourceWithIdentity` interface and defining an identity schema. Once the identity schema is defined, you can
    read and store identity data in the state file via the new `Identity` fields in the response objects on the resource CRUD methods.
