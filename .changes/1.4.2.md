## 1.4.2 (October 24, 2023)

BUG FIXES:

* resource: Add `Private` field to `DeleteResource` type, which was missing to allow provider logic to update private state on errors ([#863](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/863))
* resource: Prevented private state data loss if resource destruction returned an error ([#863](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/863))
