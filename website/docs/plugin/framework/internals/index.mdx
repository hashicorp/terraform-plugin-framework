# Framework internals

The following information describes some internals of the Terraform Plugin Framework in order to provide a more in-depth view of specific aspects of Framework behaviour.

## RPCs

Terraform core issues RPCs when Terraform commands are executed resulting in the subsequent execution of methods defined within providers.

Refer to [RPCs](/terraform/plugin/framework/internals/rpcs) for details of the [sequence of RPCs](/terraform/plugin/terraform-plugin-protocol#rpcs-and-terraform-commands) that are issued when Terraform commands are executed and Framework functionality that is called as a consequence.
