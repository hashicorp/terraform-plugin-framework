  Migrate computed blocks from SDKv2 to attribute validators in the plugin Framework.

# Computed Blocks

Some providers, resources, and data sources include repeatable nested blocks in their attributes. Some blocks contain
fields  with `Computed: true`, which means that the provider code can define the value or that it could come from the
output of terraform apply (e.g., the ID of an EC2 instance). Refer to [Schemas - Blocks](/plugin/framework/FIXME) in the
Framework documentation for details.

This page explains how to migrate computed blocks from SDKv2 to the Framework. Refer to
[Blocks](/plugin/framework/migrating/attributes-blocks/blocks) if you are looking for information about migrating blocks
that do not contain computed fields.

## SDKv2

In SDKv2, blocks are defined by an attribute whose type is `TypeList`, or `TypeSet` and whose `Elem` field is set to a
`schema.Resource` that contains a map of the block's attribute names to corresponding `schemaSchema` structs.

```go
map[string]*schema.Schema{
    "example": {
        Type:     schema.TypeList,
        Computed: true,
        Elem: &schema.Resource{
            Schema: map[string]*schema.Schema{
                "nested_example": {
                        Type:        schema.TypeString,
                        Computed:    true,
                        ...
```

## Framework

In the Framework, when working with protocol version 5, computed blocks are implemented using an attribute with a `Type`
of `types.ListType` which has an `ElemType` of `types.ObjectType`.

When working with protocol version 6, we recommend that you define computed blocks using nested attributes.

```go
map[string]tfsdk.Attribute{
"example": {
    Computed: true,
        Type: types.ListType{
            ElemType: types.ObjectType{
                AttrTypes: map[string]attr.Type{
                    "nested_example":  types.StringType,
                    ...

```
## Migration Notes

- When using protocol version 5 specify `ElemType` as `types.ObjectType` when migrating blocks that are computed from SDKv2 to Framework.
- When using protocol version 6, use [nested attributes](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/framework/schemas#attributes-1) when migrating blocks that are computed from SDKv2 to Framework.

## Example

The following examples show how to migrate portions of the [tls](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tls)
provider.

For a complete example, clone the
`terraform-provider-tls` repository and compare the `data_source_certificate.go` file in
[v3.4.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tls/blob/v3.4.0/internal/provider/data_source_certificate.go)
with
[v4.0.1](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tls/blob/v4.0.1/internal/provider/data_source_certificate.go).

### SDKv2

The following example from the `data_source_certificate.go` file shows the implementation of the `certificates` nested
block on the `certificate` data source's schema.

```go
Schema: map[string]*schema.Schema{
"certificates": {
        Type:     schema.TypeList,
        Computed: true,
        Elem: &schema.Resource{
            Schema: map[string]*schema.Schema{
                "signature_algorithm": {
                    Type:        schema.TypeString,
                    Computed:    true,
                    ...
                },
```

### Framework

The following shows the same section of provider code after the migration.

This code defines the `certificates` block as an attribute on the `certificate` data source's schema, where the
`types.ObjectType` is being used to define the nested block.

```go
map[string]tfsdk.Attribute{
    "certificates": {
        Type: types.ListType{
            ElemType: types.ObjectType{
                AttrTypes: map[string]attr.Type{
                    "signature_algorithm":  types.StringType,
            },
        },
        Computed:            true,
        ...
```
