```release-note:note
tfsdk: The `NewProtocol6Server()` function has been deprecated in preference of `NewProtocol6ProviderServer()` and `NewProtocol6ProviderServerWithError()` functions, which will simplify muxing and testing implementations. The `NewProtocol6Server()` function will be removed in an upcoming minor release before v1.0.0.
```

```

```release-note:enhancement
