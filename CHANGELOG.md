# 0.12.0 (September 12, 2022)

NOTES:

* datasource: The `DataSource` type `GetSchema` and `Metadata` methods will be required in the next version. ([#472](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/472))
* provider: The `DataSourceType` type has been deprecated in preference of moving the `GetSchema` method to the `datasource.DataSource` type  and optionally implementing the `NewResource` method logic to a new `Configure` method. The `DataSourceType` type will be removed in the next version. ([#472](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/472))
* provider: The `Provider` type `GetDataSources` method has been deprecated in preference of the `DataSources` method. All `datasource.DataSource` types must implement the `Metadata` method after migrating. Support for the `GetDataSources` method will be removed in the next version. ([#472](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/472))
* provider: The `Provider` type `GetResources` method has been deprecated in preference of the `Resources` method. All `resource.Resource` types must implement the `Metadata` method after migrating. Support for the `GetResources` method will be removed in the next version. ([#472](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/472))
* provider: The `ResourceType` type has been deprecated in preference of moving the `GetSchema` method to the `resource.Resource` type and optionally implementing the `NewResource` method logic to a new `Configure` method.  The `ResourceType` type will be removed in the next version. ([#472](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/472))
* resource: The `Resource` type `GetSchema` and `Metadata` methods will be required in the next version. ([#472](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/472))

BREAKING CHANGES:

* tfsdk: The `Schema` type `AttributeAtPath()` method signature has be updated with a `path.Path` parameter and `diag.Diagnostics` return. Use the `AttributeAtTerraformPath()` method instead if `*tftypes.AttributePath` or specific `error` handling is still necessary. ([#450](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/450))
* tfsdk: The previously deprecated `Schema` type `AttributeType()` method has been removed. Use the `Type()` method instead. ([#450](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/450))
* tfsdk: The previously deprecated `Schema` type `AttributeTypeAtPath()` method has been removed. Use the `TypeAtPath()` or `TypeAtTerraformPath()` method instead. ([#450](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/450))
* tfsdk: The previously deprecated `Schema` type `TerraformType()` method has been removed. Use `Type().TerraformType()` instead. ([#450](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/450))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* provider: Added `Provider` type `Metadata` method support, which the `MetadataResponse.TypeName` field will set the `datasource.MetadataRequest.ProviderTypeName` and `resource.MetadataRequest.ProviderTypeName` fields ([#472](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/472))
* resource: Added `Resource` type `Configure`, `GetSchema`, and `Metadata` method support ([#472](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/472))

BUG FIXES:

* internal/fwserver: Delayed deprecated attribute/block warnings for unknown values, which may be null ([#465](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/465))
* internal/fwserver: Fixed alignment of set type plan modification ([#468](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/468))

# 0.11.1 (August 15, 2022)

BUG FIXES:
* resource: Prevented `Error Decoding Private State` errors on resources previously managed by terraform-plugin-sdk ([#452](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/452))

# 0.11.0 (August 11, 2022)

NOTES:

* This Go module has been updated to Go 1.18 per the [Go support policy](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy). Any consumers building on earlier Go versions may experience errors. ([#445](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/445))
* tfsdk: The `Schema` type `AttributeAtPath()` method signature will be updated from a `*tftypes.AttributePath` parameter to `path.Path` in the next release. Switch to the `AttributeAtTerraformPath()` method if `*tftypes.AttributePath` handling is still necessary. ([#440](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/440))
* tfsdk: The `Schema` type `AttributeType()` method has been deprecated in preference of the `Type()` method. ([#440](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/440))
* tfsdk: The `Schema` type `AttributeTypeAtPath()` method has been deprecated for the `TypeAtPath()` and `TypeAtTerraformPath()` methods. ([#440](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/440))
* tfsdk: The `Schema` type `TerraformType()` method has been deprecated in preference of calling `Type().TerraformType()`. ([#440](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/440))

BREAKING CHANGES:

* tfsdk: Go types relating to data source handling have been migrated to the new `datasource` package. Consult the pull request description for a full listing of find-and-replace information. ([#432](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/432))
* tfsdk: Go types relating to provider handling have been migrated to the new `provider` package. Consult the pull request description for a full listing of find-and-replace information. ([#432](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/432))
* tfsdk: Go types relating to resource handling have been migrated to the new `resource` package. Consult the pull request description for a full listing of find-and-replace information. ([#432](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/432))
* tfsdk: The `RequiresReplace()`, `RequiresReplaceIf()`, and `UseStateForUnknown()` plan modifier functions, which only apply to managed resources, have been moved to the `resource` package. ([#434](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/434))
* tfsdk: The `ResourceImportStatePassthroughID()` function has been moved to `resource.ImportStatePassthroughID()`. ([#432](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/432))
* tfsdk: The `Schema` type `AttributeAtPath` method now returns a `fwschema.Attribute` interface instead of a `tfsdk.Attribute` type. Consumers will need to update from direct field usage to similarly named interface method calls. ([#438](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/438))

FEATURES:

* datasource: New package, which colocates all data source implementation types from the `tfsdk` package ([#432](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/432))
* provider: New package, which colocates all provider implementation types from the `tfsdk` package ([#432](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/432))
* resource: Enabled provider developers to read/write private state data. ([#433](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/433))
* resource: New package, which colocates all resource implementation types from the `tfsdk` package ([#432](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/432))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* tfsdk: Added `Block` type `MaxItems` and `MinItems` field validation for Terraform 0.12 through 0.15.1 ([#422](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/422))

BUG FIXES:

* internal/fwserver: Ensured `UpgradeResourceState` calls from Terraform 0.12 properly ignored attributes not defined in the schema ([#426](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/426))
* path: Ensured `Expression` type `Copy()` method appropriately copied root expressions and `Equal()` checked for root versus relative expressions ([#420](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/420))

# 0.10.0 (July 18, 2022)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* attr: The `TypeWithValidate` interface has been moved under the `attr/xattr` package and the `*tftypes.AttributePath` parameter is replaced with `path.Path` ([#390](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/390))
* diag: The `DiagnosticWithPath` interface `Path` method `*tftypes.AttributePath` return is replaced with `path.Path` ([#390](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/390))
* diag: The `Diagnostics` type `AddAttributeError` and `AddAttributeWarning` method `*tftypes.AttributePath` parameters are replaced with `path.Path` ([#390](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/390))
* diag: The `NewAttributeErrorDiagnostic` and `NewAttributeWarningDiagnostic` function `*tftypes.AttributePath` parameters are replaced with `path.Path` ([#390](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/390))
* tfsdk: The `Config`, `Plan`, and `State` types `GetAttribute` and `SetAttribute` methods `*tftypes.AttributePath` parameters are replaced with `path.Path` ([#390](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/390))
* tfsdk: The `DataSourceConfigValidator` interface `Validate` method is now `ValidateDataSource` to support generic validators that satisfy `DataSourceConfigValidator`, `ProviderConfigValidator`, and `ResourceConfigValidator` ([#405](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/405))
* tfsdk: The `ModifyAttributePlanRequest`, `ModifyResourcePlanResponse`, and `ValidateAttributeRequest` type `AttributePath *tftypes.AttributePath` fields are replaced with `AttributePath path.Path` ([#390](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/390))
* tfsdk: The `PlanResourceChange` RPC on destroy is now enabled. To prevent unexpected Terraform errors, the framework attempts to catch errant provider logic in plan modifiers when destroying. Resource level plan modifiers may require updates to handle a completely null proposed new state (plan) and ensure it remains completely null on resource destruction. ([#409](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/409))
* tfsdk: The `ProviderConfigValidator` interface `Validate` method is now `ValidateProvider` to support generic validators that satisfy `DataSourceConfigValidator`, `ProviderConfigValidator`, and `ResourceConfigValidator` ([#405](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/405))
* tfsdk: The `RequiresReplaceIf` and `ResourceImportStatePassthroughID` function `*tftypes.AttributePath` parameters are replaced with `path.Path` ([#390](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/390))
* tfsdk: The `ResourceConfigValidator` interface `Validate` method is now `ValidateResource` to support generic validators that satisfy `DataSourceConfigValidator`, `ProviderConfigValidator`, and `ResourceConfigValidator` ([#405](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/405))

FEATURES:

* Support plan modifiers returning warning and error diagnostics on resource destruction with Terraform 1.3 and later ([#409](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/409))
* path: Introduced attribute path expressions ([#396](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/396))
* path: Introduced framework abstraction for attribute path handling ([#390](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/390))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* diag: Added `Diagnostics` type `Equal()` method ([#402](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/402))
* diag: `ErrorsCount`, `WarningsCount`, `Errors` and `Warnings` functions have been added to `diag.Diagnostics` ([#392](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/392))
* providerserver: Added sdk.proto logger request duration and response diagnostics logging ([#398](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/398))
* tfsdk: Added `AttributePathExpression` field to `ModifyAttributePlanRequest` and `ValidateAttributeRequest` types ([#396](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/396))
* tfsdk: Added `PathMatches` method to `Config`, `Plan`, and `State` types ([#396](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/396))
* tfsdk: Added framework-specific error diagnostics when `Resource` implementations errantly return no errors and empty state after `Create` and `Update` methods ([#406](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/406))
* types: Method `IsNull()` for `Number` type will now return true if the struct is zero-value initialized. ([#384](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/384))

# 0.9.0 (June 15, 2022)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* attr: The `Value` interface now includes the `IsNull()` and `IsUnknown()` methods ([#335](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/335))
* attr: The `Value` interface now includes the `String()` method ([#376](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/376))
* tfsdk: `ListNestedAttributes`, `SetNestedAttributes` and `MapNestedAttributes` functions lost the second argument `opts`, as it was unused. ([#349](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/349))

FEATURES:

* providerserver: Implemented native protocol version 5 support ([#368](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/368))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* providerserver: Added `NewProtocol5()` and `NewProtocol5WithError()` functions, which return a protocol version 5 compatible provider server ([#368](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/368))
* providerserver: Added `ServeOpts` type `ProtocolVersion` field, which can be set to `5` or `6` and defaults to `6` ([#368](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/368))
* tfsdk: New function `ValueFrom` that takes a Go value and populates a compatible `attr.Value`, given a descriptive `attr.Type`. ([#350](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/350))
* tfsdk: Removed `ListNestedAttributesOptions`, `SetNestedAttributesOptions` and `MapNestedAttributesOptions` types, as they were empty (no fields) and unused. ([#349](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/349))
* types: Added `IsNull()` and `IsUnknown()` methods to all types ([#335](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/335))
* types: Added `String()` method to all types ([#376](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/376))

BUG FIXES:

* tfsdk: Prevented configuration handling error when `Schema` contained `Blocks` ([#371](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/371))
* types: Prevented panic being thrown when `.ToTerraformValue` is called on an `attr.Value` type where `ElemType / AttrsType` were not set. ([#354](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/354))
* types: Prevented potential loss of number precision with `Int64` between 54 and 64 bits ([#325](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/325))

# 0.8.0 (May 6, 2022)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* diag: Removed `Diagnostics` type `ToTfprotov6Diagnostics()` method. This was not intended for usage by provider developers. ([#313](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/313))
* tfsdk: The `ModifySchemaPlanRequest`, `ModifySchemaPlanResponse`, `ValidateSchemaRequest`, and `ValidateSchemaResponse` types have been removed. These were not intended for provider developer usage. ([#310](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/310))
* tfsdk: The `NewProtocol6Server()` function, `Serve()` function, and `ServeOpts` type have been removed. Use the `providerserver` package instead. ([#310](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/310))
* tfsdk: The `ResourceImportStateNotImplemented()` function has been removed. Remove the `Resource` type `ImportState` method instead for resources that should not support import. ([#312](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/312))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* tfsdk: Propagated `tf_data_source_type`, `tf_req_id`, `tf_resource_type`, and `tf_rpc` fields in log entries ([#315](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/315))

BUG FIXES:

* all: Prevented `This log was generated by an SDK subsystem logger that wasn't created before being used.` warning messages in logging ([#314](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/314))
* tfsdk: Prevented `Unable to create logging subsystem with AdditionalLocationOffset due to missing root logger options` warning logs during acceptance testing ([#315](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/315))

# 0.7.0 (April 28, 2022)

NOTES:

* tfsdk: Providers may now optionally remove `RemoveResource()` calls from `Resource` type `Delete` methods ([#301](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/301))
* tfsdk: The `NewProtocol6Server()` function has been deprecated in preference of `providerserver.NewProtocol6()` and `providerserver.NewProtocol6WithError()` functions, which will simplify muxing and testing implementations. The `tfsdk.NewProtocol6Server()` function will be removed in the next minor version. ([#308](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/308))
* tfsdk: The `ResourceImportStateNotImplemented()` function has been deprecated. Instead, the `ImportState` method can be removed from the `Resource` and the framework will automatically return an error diagnostic if import is attempted. ([#297](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/297))
* tfsdk: The `Resource` interface no longer requires the `ImportState` method. A separate `ResourceWithImportState` interface now defines the same `ImportState` method. ([#297](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/297))
* tfsdk: The `Serve()` function has been deprecated in preference of the `providerserver.Serve()` function. The `tfsdk.Serve()` function will be removed in the next minor version. ([#308](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/308))
* tfsdk: The `ServeOpts` type has been deprecated in preference of the `providerserver.ServeOpts` type. When migrating, the `Name` field has been replaced with `Address`. The `tfsdk.ServeOpts` type will be removed in the next minor version. ([#308](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/308))
* tfsdk: The previously unexported `server` type has been temporarily exported to aid in the migration to the new `providerserver` package. It is not intended for provider developer usage and will be moved into an internal package in the next minor version. ([#308](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/308))

FEATURES:

* Introduced `providerserver` package, which contains all functions and types necessary for serving a provider in production or acceptance testing. ([#308](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/308))
* tfsdk: Added optional `ResourceWithUpgradeState` interface, which allows for provider defined logic when the `UpgradeResourceState` RPC is called ([#292](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/292))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* tfsdk: Added `DEBUG` level logging for all framework handoffs to provider defined logic ([#300](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/300))
* tfsdk: Added `ResourceWithImportState` interface, which allows `Resource` implementations to optionally define the `ImportState` method. ([#297](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/297))
* tfsdk: Added automatic `(DeleteResourceResponse.State).RemoveResource()` call after `Resource` type `Delete` method execution if there are no errors ([#301](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/301))

# 0.6.1 (March 29, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

* types: Prevented panics with missing type information during `Float64`, `Int64`, and `Set` validation logic ([#259](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/259))

# 0.6.0 (March 10, 2022)

NOTES:

* The underlying `terraform-plugin-log` dependency has been updated to v0.3.0, which includes a breaking change in the optional additional fields parameter of logging function calls to ensure correctness and catch coding errors during compilation. Any early adopter provider logging which calls those functions may require updates. ([#268](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/268))

BREAKING CHANGES:

* The `ToTerraformValue` method of the `attr.Value` interface now returns a `tftypes.Value`, instead of an `interface{}`. Existing types need to be updated to call `tftypes.ValidateValue` and `tftypes.NewValue`, passing the value they were returning before, instead of returning the value directly. ([#231](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/231))
* tfsdk: The `ListNestedAttributesOptions`, `MapNestedAttributeOptions`, and `SetNestedAttributeOptions` type `MaxItems` and `MinItems` fields have been removed since the protocol and framework never supported this type of nested attribute validation. Use attribute validators instead. ([#249](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/249))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added the ability to get an attribute as a generic `attr.Value` when using `GetAttribute`. ([#232](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/232))
* Logging can now be used by calling `tflog.Trace`, `tflog.Debug`, `tflog.Info`, `tflog.Warn`, or `tflog.Error`. See [the tflog docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log/tflog) for more information. ([#234](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/234))
* tfsdk: Added `Debug` field to `ServeOpts` for running providers via debugger and testing processes ([#243](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/243))

BUG FIXES:

* tfsdk: Removed `Schema` restriction that it must contain at least one attribute or block ([#252](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/252))
* tfsdk: Support protocol version 5 and verify valid resource type in `UpgradeResourceState` RPC ([#263](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/263))

# 0.5.0 (November 30, 2021)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Fixed RequiresReplace and RequiresReplaceIf to be more judicious about when they require a resource to be destroyed and recreated. They will no longer require resources to be recreated when _any_ attribute changes, instead limiting it only to the attribute they're declared on. They will also not require resources to be recreated when they're being created or deleted. Finally, they won't require a resource to be recreated if the user has no value in the config for the attribute and the attribute is computed; this is to prevent the resource from being destroyed and recreated when the provider changes the value without any user prompting. Providers that wish to destroy and recreate the resource when an optional and computed attribute is removed from the user's config should do so in their own plan modifier. ([#213](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/213))
* RequiresReplaceIf no longer overrides previous plan modifiers' value for RequiresReplace if the function returns false. ([#213](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/213))
* diag: The `AttributeErrorDiagnostic` and `AttributeWarningDiagnostic` types have been removed. Any usage can be replaced with `DiagnosticWithPath`. ([#219](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/219))
* tfsdk: The `AddAttributeError`, `AddAttributeWarning`, `AddError`, and `AddWarning` methods on the `ConfigureProviderResponse`, `CreateResourceResponse`, `DeleteResourceResponse`, `ModifyAttributePlanResponse`, `ModifyResourcePlanResponse`, `ReadDataSourceResponse`, `ReadResourceResponse`, and `UpdateResourceResponse` types have been removed in preference of the same methods on the `Diagnostics` field of these types. For example, code such as `resp.AddError("...", "...")` can be updated to `resp.Diagnostics.AddError("...", "...")`. ([#198](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/198))
* tfsdk: The `Config`, `Plan`, and `State` type `GetAttribute` methods now return diagnostics only and require the target as the last parameter, similar to the `Get` method. ([#167](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/167))

FEATURES:

* Added `tfsdk.UseStateForUnknown()` as a built-in plan modifier, which will automatically replace an unknown value in the plan with the value from the state. This mimics the behavior of computed and optional+computed values in Terraform Plugin SDK versions 1 and 2. Provider developers will likely want to use it for "write-once" attributes that never change once they're set in state. ([#204](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/204))
* tfsdk: Support list and set blocks in schema definitions ([#188](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/188))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* diag: Added `WithPath()` function to wrap or overwrite diagnostic path information. ([#219](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/219))
* tfsdk: The `Config`, `Plan`, and `State` type `GetAttribute` methods can now be used to fetch values directly into `attr.Value` implementations and Go types. ([#167](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/167))

BUG FIXES:

* tfsdk: Fetch null values from valid missing `Config`, `Plan`, and `State` paths in `GetAttribute()` method ([#185](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/185))
* types: Ensure `Float64` `Type()` method returns `Float64Type` ([#202](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/202))
* types: Prevent panic with uninitialized `Number` `Value` ([#200](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/200))
* types: Prevent panics when `ValueFromTerraform` received `nil` values ([#208](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/208))

# 0.4.2 (September 29, 2021)

BUG FIXES:
* Fix bug in which updating `Computed`-only attributes would lead to a "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply" error ([#176](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/176)/[#184](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/184))

# 0.4.1 (September 27, 2021)

NOTES:
* Upgraded to terraform-plugin-go v0.4.0 which contains its own breaking changes. Please see https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#040-september-24-2021 for more details. ([#179](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/179))

# 0.4.0 (September 24, 2021)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* `attr.Type` implementations must now have a `String()` method that returns a human-friendly name for the type. ([#120](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/120))
* tfsdk: `Resource` implementations must now include the `ImportState(context.Context, ImportResourceStateRequest, *ImportResourceStateResponse)` method. If import is not supported, call the `ResourceImportStateNotImplemented()` function or return an error. ([#149](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/149))

FEATURES:
* tfsdk: Support resource import ([#149](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/149))
* types: Support `Set` and `SetType` ([#126](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/126))
* types: Support for `Float64`, `Float64Type`, `Int64`, and `Int64Type` ([#166](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/166))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* Added a `tfsdk.ConvertValue` helper that will convert any `attr.Value` into any compatible `attr.Type`. Compatibility happens at the terraform-plugin-go level; the type that the `attr.Value`'s `ToTerraformValue` method produces must be compatible with the `attr.Type`'s `TerraformType()`. Generally, this means that the `attr.Type` of the `attr.Value` and the `attr.Type` being converted to must both produce the same `tftypes.Type` when their `TerraformType()` method is called. ([#120](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/120))

BUG FIXES:
* attr: Ensure `List` types implementing `attr.TypeWithValidate` call `ElementType` validation only if that type implements `attr.TypeWithValidate` ([#126](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/126))
* tfsdk: `(Plan).SetAttribute()` and `(State).SetAttribute()` will now create missing attribute paths instead of silently failing to update. ([#165](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/165))

# 0.3.0 (September 08, 2021)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* Methods on the `tfsdk.Config`, `tfsdk.Plan`, and `tfsdk.State` types now return `[]*tfprotov6.Diagnostic` instead of `error` ([#82](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/82))
* Most uses of `[]*tfprotov6.Diagnostic` have been replaced with a new `diag.Diagnostics` type. Please update your type signatures, and use one of the `diags.New*` helper functions instead of constructing `*tfprotov6.Diagnostic`s by hand. ([#110](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/110))
* The `schema.Attribute` and `schema.Schema` types have been moved to `tfsdk.Attribute` and `tfsdk.Schema`. No changes beyond import names are required. ([#77](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/77))
* With the release of Go 1.17, Go 1.17 is now the lowest supported version of Go to use with terraform-plugin-framework. ([#104](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/104))
* `attr.Value` implementations must now implement a `Type(context.Context)` method that returns the `attr.Type` that created the `attr.Value`. ([#119](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/119))

FEATURES:
* Added support for ModifyPlan functions on Resources. ([#90](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/90))
* Introduced first-class diagnostics (`diag` package). ([#110](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/110))
* Support `attr.Type` validation ([#82](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/82))
* tfsdk: Attributes, Data Sources, Providers, and Resources now support configuration validation ([#75](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/75))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* Added a `tfsdk.ValueAs` helper that allows accessing an `attr.Value` without type assertion, by using the same reflection rules used in the `Config.Get`, `Plan.Get`, and `State.Get` helpers. ([#119](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/119))
* Errors from methods on the `tfsdk.Config`, `tfsdk.Plan`, and `tfsdk.State` types now include rich diagnostic information ([#82](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/82))
* tfsdk: Validate `Attribute` defines at least one of `Required`, `Optional`, or `Computed` ([#111](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/111))

BUG FIXES:
* tfsdk: Diagnostics returned from `(Plan).SetAttribute()` and `(State).SetAttribute()` reflection will now properly include attribute path ([#133](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/133))
* tfsdk: Don't attempt validation on the nested attributes of a null or unknown `SingleNestedAttribute` ([#118](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/118))
* tfsdk: Return warning diagnostic when using `Attribute` or `Schema` type `DeprecationMessage` field ([#93](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/93))

# 0.2.0 (July 22, 2021)

ENHANCEMENTS:
* Added `tfsdk.NewProtocol6Server` to return a `tfprotov6.ProviderServer` implementation for testing and muxing purposes. ([#72](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/72))
* Added support for MapNestedAttributes. ([#79](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/79))
* Responses now default to returning the current state, meaning state will only change when provider developers actively change it. Previously, an empty state value would be returned, which caused problems. ([#74](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/74))

# 0.1.0 (June 24, 2021)

FEATURES:

* Added interfaces extending the attr.Type interface to include attribute and element types. ([#44](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/44))
* Added state, config, and plan types, and support for getting values from them. ([#46](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/46))
* Added support for Object types. ([#38](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/38))
* Added support for bools, numbers, and strings. ([#29](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/29))
* Added support for defining schemas and attributes. ([#27](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/27))
* Added support for lists. ([#36](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/36))
* Added support for maps. ([#37](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/37))
* Added support for provider, resource, and data source types. ([#32](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/32))
* Added the ability to serve providers. ([#45](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/45))
