# Schemas

Schemas specify the constraints of Terraform configuration blocks. They define what fields a provider,
resource, or data source configuration block has, and give Terraform metadata
about those fields. You can think of the schema as the "type information" or
the "shape" of a resource, data source, or provider.

Each concept has its own `schema` package and `Schema` type, which defines functionality available to that concept:

- [Providers](/terraform/plugin/framework/providers): [`provider/schema.Schema`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/provider/schema#Schema)
- [Resources](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources): [`resource/schema.Schema`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/resource/schema#Schema)
- [Data Sources](/terraform/plugin/framework/data-sources): [`datasource/schema.Schema`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/datasource/schema#Schema)

During execution of the [`terraform validate`](/terraform/cli/commands/validate), [`terraform plan`](/terraform/cli/commands/plan) and [`terraform apply`](/terraform/cli/commands/apply) commands, Terraform calls the provider [`GetProviderSchema`](/terraform/plugin/framework/internals/rpcs#getproviderschema-rpc) RPC, in which the framework calls the [`provider.Provider` interface `Schema` method](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/provider#Provider.Schema), and the [`resource.Resource` interface `Schema` method](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/resource#Resource.Schema) and [`datasource.DataSource` interface `Schema` method](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/datasource#DataSource.Schema) on each of the resources and data sources, respectively.

## Version

-> Version is only valid for resources.

Every schema has a version, which is an integer that allows you to track changes to your schemas. It is generally only used when
[upgrading resource state](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/state-upgrade), to help massage resources created with earlier
schemas into the shape defined by the current schema. It will never be used for
provider or data source schemas and can be omitted.

## DeprecationMessage

Not every resource, data source, or provider will be supported forever.
Sometimes designs change or APIs are deprecated. Schemas that have their
`DeprecationMessage` property set will display that message as a warning when
that provider, data source, or resource is used. A good message will tell
practitioners that the provider, resource, or data source is deprecated, and
will indicate a migration strategy.

## Description

Various tooling like
[terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs) and
the [language server](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls) can use
metadata in the schema to generate documentation or offer a better editor
experience for practitioners. Use the `Description` property to add a description of a resource, data source, or provider that these tools can leverage.

## MarkdownDescription

Similar to the `Description` property, the `MarkdownDescription` is used to
provide a markdown-formatted version of the description to tooling like
[terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs). It
is a best practice to only alter the formatting, not the content, between the
`Description` and `MarkdownDescription`.

At the moment, if the `MarkdownDescription` property is set it will always be
used instead of the `Description` property. It is possible that a different strategy may be employed in the future to surface descriptions to other tooling in a different format, so we recommend specifying both fields.

## Attributes

Attributes are the main point of a schema. They are used to describe the fields
of a provider, resource, or data source. Attributes are defined as a map of
string names to definitions.

The name should only contain lowercase
letters, numbers, and underscores. Practitioners will enter these strings in
the configuration block of the provider, resource, or data source to set a
value for that field.

The value is the implementation details for the attribute.

Refer to [Attributes](/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/attributes) for further details of the different types of attributes.

### Required

Setting the `Required` property to `true` indicates that the attribute is
required. Practitioners will be automatically given a validation error if they
omit the attribute in their configuration.

Attributes that set `Required` to `true` cannot set `Optional` or `Computed` to
`true`.

### Optional

Setting the `Optional` property to `true` indicates that the attribute is
optional. Practitioners are free to specify that attribute or omit it, and
Terraform will not automatically generate a validation error based on the
presence or absence of that attribute.

Attributes that set `Optional` to `true` cannot set `Required` to `true`, but
may set `Computed` to `true`, in which case the behavior of `Computed` applies,
too.

### Computed

Setting the `Computed` property to `true` indicates that the attribute can be
set by the provider. Any attribute that does not have `Computed` set to `true`
cannot be influenced by the provider; it can only be changed via the config or
via state refreshing.

If `Computed` is set to `true` and `Optional` is not set to `true`, the
attribute will be considered read-only and Terraform will automatically
generate a validation error if the practitioner attempts to enter a
configuration value for that attribute.

If `Computed` is set to `true` and `Optional` is set to `true`, Terraform will
not do any validation on the presence or absence of the value.

If `Computed` is set to `true`, `Required` must not be set to `true`.

Because providers don't set provider configuration values in state, provider
schemas should never set `Computed` to `true`.

### Sensitive

Setting the `Sensitive` property to `true` indicates to Terraform that the
value should always be considered
[sensitive](/terraform/language/state/sensitive-data). This does not at this
time add any encryption or otherwise hide the value from Terraform; see [the
documentation for SDKv2](/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/best-practices/sensitive-state) for
more information on sensitive state and Terraform. It does, however, hide the
value in Terraform's outputs and in Terraform Cloud.

### Description

Much like [resources, data sources, and providers can have a
description](#description), so too can individual attributes.

### MarkdownDescription

Much like [resources, data sources, and providers can have a markdown-formatted
description](#markdowndescription), so too can individual attributes.

### DeprecationMessage

Individual attributes can be deprecated similar to resources, data sources, and providers. When the `DeprecationMessage` value is a non-empty string, the framework will automatically raise a warning diagnostic to practitioners if a configuration value (known or unknown) or reference is detected for the attribute during Terraform's validation phase:

```text
Warning: Attribute Deprecated

{Configuration file/line information}

{DeprecationMessage field value}
```

Use a practitioner actionable recommendation in `DeprecationMessage`, such as `"Configure other_attribute instead. This attribute will be removed in the next major version of the provider."` or `"Remove this attribute's configuration as it's no longer in use and the attribute will be removed in the next major version of the provider."`.

~> **NOTE**: In Terraform 1.2.6 and earlier, a deprecation warning diagnostic is only raised for configurable (`Required` or `Optional`) attributes when a configuration value is detected. A warning diagnostic is not raised for read-only (`Computed` only) attributes when referenced.

### Validators

Each attribute can implement [value validation](/terraform/plugin/framework/validation), either by specifying the [`Attribute` type `Validators` field](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#Attribute.Validators) and/or by declaring a custom type in the `Type` field that [implements its own validators](/terraform/plugin/framework/validation#type-validation). Common use case validators can be found in the [terraform-plugin-framework-validators Go module](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-validators).

During execution of the [`terraform validate`](/terraform/cli/commands/validate), [`terraform plan`](/terraform/cli/commands/plan) and [`terraform apply`](/terraform/cli/commands/apply) commands, Terraform calls the provider [`ValidateProviderConfig`](/terraform/plugin/framework/internals/rpcs#validateproviderconfig-rpc), [`ValidateResourceConfig`](/terraform/plugin/framework/internals/rpcs#validateresourceconfig-rpc) and [`ValidateDataResourceConfig`](/terraform/plugin/framework/internals/rpcs#validatedataresourceconfig-rpc) RPCs, during which [value validation](/terraform/plugin/framework/validation) takes place.

## Unit Testing

Schemas can be unit tested via each of the `schema.Schema` type `ValidateImplementation()` methods. This unit testing raises schema implementation issues more quickly in comparison to [acceptance tests](/terraform/plugin/framework/acctests), but does not replace the purpose of acceptance testing.

In this example, a `thing_resource_test.go` file is created alongside the `thing_resource.go` implementation file:

```go
import (
  "context"
  "testing"

  // The fwresource import alias is so there is no collistion
  // with the more typical acceptance testing import:
  // "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/helper/resource"
  fwresource "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/resource"
)

func TestThingResourceSchema(t *testing.T) {
  t.Parallel()

  ctx := context.Background()
  schemaRequest := fwresource.SchemaRequest{}
  schemaResponse := &fwresource.SchemaResponse{}

  // Instantiate the resource.Resource and call its Schema method
  NewThingResource().Schema(ctx, schemaRequest, schemaResponse)

  if schemaResponse.Diagnostics.HasError() {
    t.Fatalf("Schema method diagnostics: %+v", schemaResponse.Diagnostics)
  }

  // Validate the schema
  diagnostics := schemaResponse.Schema.ValidateImplementation(ctx)

  if diagnostics.HasError() {
    t.Fatalf("Schema validation diagnostics: %+v", diagnostics)
  }
}
```
