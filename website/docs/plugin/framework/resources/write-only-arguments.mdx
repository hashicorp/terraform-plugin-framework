  How to implement write-only arguments with the provider development framework.

# Write-only Arguments

Write-only arguments are managed resource attributes that are configured by practitioners but are not persisted to the Terraform plan or state artifacts. Write-only arguments are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.
Write-only arguments should be used to handle secret values that do not need to be persisted in Terraform state, such as passwords, API keys, etc.
The provider is expected to be the terminal point for an ephemeral value,
which should either use the value by making the appropriate change to the API or ignore the value. Write-only arguments can accept [ephemeral values](/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral) and are not required to be consistent between plan and apply operations.

## General Concepts

The following are high level differences between `Required`/`Optional` arguments and write-only arguments:

- Write-only arguments can accept ephemeral and non-ephemeral values.

- Write-only arguments cannot be used with set attributes, set nested attributes, and set nested blocks.

- Write-only argument values are only available in the configuration. The prior state, planned state, and final state values for
write-only arguments should always be `null`.
  - Provider developers do not need to explicitly set write-only argument values to `null` after using them as the plugin framework will handle the nullification of write-only arguments for all RPCs.

- Any value that is set for a write-only argument in the state or plan (during [Plan Modification](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/plan-modification)) by the provider will be reverted to `null` by plugin framework before the RPC response is sent to Terraform.

- Write-only argument values cannot produce a Terraform plan difference.
  - This is because the prior state value for a write-only argument will always be `null` and the planned/final state value will also be `null`, therefore, it cannot produce a diff on its own.
  - The one exception to this case is if the write-only argument is added to `requires_replace` during Plan Modification (i.e., using the [`RequiresReplace()`](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/plan-modification#requiresreplace) plan modifier), in that case, the write-only argument will always cause a diff/trigger a resource recreation.

- Since write-only arguments can accept ephemeral values, write-only argument configuration values are not expected to be consistent between plan and apply.

## Schema

An attribute can be made write-only by setting the `WriteOnly` field to `true` in the schema. Attributes with `WriteOnly` set to `true` must also have
one of `Required` or `Optional` set to `true`. If a list nested, map nested, or single nested attribute has `WriteOnly` set to `true`, all child attributes must also have `WriteOnly` set to `true`.
A set nested block cannot have any child attributes with `WriteOnly` set to `true`. `Computed` cannot be set to true for write-only arguments.

**Schema example:**

```go
"password_wo": schema.StringAttribute{
  Required:  true,
  WriteOnly: true,
},
```

## Retrieving Write-only Values

Write-only argument values should be retrieved from the configuration instead of the plan. Refer to [accessing values](/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/accessing-values) for more details on
retrieving values from configuration.

## PreferWriteOnlyAttribute Validators

The `PreferWriteOnlyAttribute()` validators available in the [`terraform-plugin-framework-validators` Go module](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-validators)
can be used when you have a write-only version of an existing attribute, and you want to encourage practitioners to use the write-only version whenever possible.

The validator returns a warning if the Terraform client is 1.11 or above and the value of the existing attribute is non-null.

`PreferWriteOnlyAttribute()` is available as a resource-level validator in the [`resourcevalidator` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-validators/resourcevalidator) or
as an attribute-level validator in the `[type]validator` packages (i.e., [`stringvalidator` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-validators/stringvalidator))

Usage:

```go
// Resource-level validator
// Used inside a resource.Resource type ConfigValidators method
    _ = []resource.ConfigValidator{
        // Throws a warning diagnostic encouraging practitioners to use
		// password_wo if password has a known value
        resourcevalidator.PreferWriteOnlyAttribute(
            path.MatchRoot("password"),
            path.MatchRoot("password_wo"),
        ),
    }

// Attribute-level validator
// Used within a Schema method of a Resource
    _ = schema.Schema{
        Attributes: map[string]schema.Attribute{
            "password": schema.StringAttribute{
                Optional: true,
                Validators: []validator.String{
                    // Throws a warning diagnostic encouraging practitioners to use
                    // password_wo if password has a known value.
                    stringvalidator.PreferWriteOnlyAttribute(
                        path.MatchRoot("password_wo"),
                    ),
                },
            },
            "password_wo": schema.StringAttribute{
                WriteOnly: true,
                Optional:  true,
            },
        },
    }
```

```hcl
resource "example_db_instance" "ex" {
  username = "foo"
  password = "bar" # returns a warning encouraging practitioners to use `password_wo` instead.
}
```

## Best Practices

Since write-only arguments have no prior values, user intent or value changes cannot be determined with a write-only argument alone. To determine when to use/not use a write-only argument value in your provider, we recommend one of the following:

- Pair write-only arguments with a configuration attribute (required or optional) to “trigger” the use of the write-only argument
  - For example, a `password_wo` write-only argument can be paired with a configured `password_wo_version` attribute. When the `password_wo_version` is modified, the provider will send the `password_wo` value to the API.
- Use a keepers attribute (which is used in the [Random Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs#resource-keepers)) that will take in arbitrary key-pair values. Whenever there is a change to the `keepers` attribute, the provider will use the write-only argument value.
- Use the resource's [private state](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/private-state) to store secure hashes of write-only argument values, the provider will then use the hash to determine if a write-only argument value has changed in later Terraform runs.
