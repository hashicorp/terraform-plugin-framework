## 1.15.0-alpha.1 (March 18, 2025)

NOTES:

* all: This Go module has been updated to Go 1.23 per the [Go support policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy). It is recommended to review the [Go 1.23 release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.23) before upgrading. Any consumers building on earlier Go versions may experience errors. ([#1114](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1114))
* This alpha pre-release contains an initial implementation for managed resource identity, which can used with Terraform v1.12.0-alpha20250312, to store and read identity data during plan and apply workflows. A managed resource identity can be used by implementing the optional `resource.ResourceWithIdentity` interface and defining an identity schema. Once the identity schema is defined, you can read and store identity data in the state file via the new `Identity` fields in the response objects on the resource CRUD methods.
