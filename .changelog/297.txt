```release-note:note
tfsdk: The `Resource` interface no longer requires the `ImportState` method. A separate `ResourceWithImportState` interface now defines the same `ImportState` method.
```

```release-note:note
tfsdk: The `ResourceImportStateNotImplemented()` function has been deprecated. Instead, the `ImportState` method can be removed from the `Resource` and the framework will automatically return an error diagnostic if import is attempted.
```

```release-note:enhancement
tfsdk: Added `ResourceWithImportState` interface, which allows `Resource` implementations to optionally define the `ImportState` method.
```
