```release-note:feature
Support plan modifiers returning warning and error diagnostics on resource destruction with Terraform 1.3 and later
```

```release-note:breaking-change
tfsdk: The `PlanResourceChange` RPC on destroy is now enabled. To prevent unexpected Terraform errors, the framework attempts to catch errant provider logic in plan modifiers when destroying. Resource level plan modifiers may require updates to handle a completely null proposed new state (plan) and ensure it remains completely null on resource destruction.
