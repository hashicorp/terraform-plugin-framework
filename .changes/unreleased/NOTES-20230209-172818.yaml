kind: NOTES
body: New `DEBUG` level `Detected value change between proposed new state and prior
  state` log messages with the offending attribute path are now emitted when proposed
  new state value differences would cause the framework to automatically mark all
  unconfigured `Computed` attributes as unknown during planning. These can be used
  to troubleshoot potential resource implementation issues, or framework and Terraform
  plan logic bugs.
