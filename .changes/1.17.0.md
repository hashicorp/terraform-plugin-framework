## 1.17.0 (December 02, 2025)

NOTES:

* In `terraform-plugin-framework@v1.15.1`, the `UseStateForUnknown` plan modifier was updated to preserve null values from prior state for unconfigured attributes. This updated version can cause plan inconsistency errors when used on child attributes of a nested attribute that expect `UseStateForUnknown` to keep the child attributes on new nested objects as `<unknown>` (known after apply).
The new `UseNonNullStateForUnknown` plan modifier can now be used where child attributes are expecting this pre-1.15.1 behavior. ([#1197](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1197))

FEATURES:

* action/schema: Added `WriteOnly` schema field for action schemas. ([#1233](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1233))
* all: Added a new plan modifier for all types, `UseNonNullStateForUnknown` that preserves known, non-null, values for unconfigured attributes. This can be used when it is known that an unconfigured value will remain the same after the attribute is updated to a non-null value. ([#1242](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1242))

BUG FIXES:

* fwserver: update validation list result validation to check if an identity's values are all null ([#1230](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1230))
