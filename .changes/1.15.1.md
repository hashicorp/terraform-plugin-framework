## 1.15.1 (July 31, 2025)

NOTES:

* This release contains a change in behavior for the `UseStateForUnknown` plan modifier, which will now preserve null values from prior state for unconfigured attributes. This updated version can cause plan inconsistency errors when used on child attributes of a nested attribute that expect `UseStateForUnknown` to keep the child attributes on new nested objects as `<unknown>` (known after apply). See [#1197](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1197) for more details.

BUG FIXES:

* all: Fixed bug with `UseStateForUnknown` where known null state values were not preserved during update plans. ([#1117](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1117))
