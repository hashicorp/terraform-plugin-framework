  How to implement a provider in the provider development framework. Providers

# Providers

Providers are Terraform plugins that supply
[resources](/plugin/framework/resources) and [data
sources](/plugin/framework/data-sources) for practitioners to use.
They are implemented as binaries that the Terraform CLI downloads, starts,
and stops. The provider is responsible for:

- providing a [gRPC](https://grpc.io) server that can correctly handle
  Terraform's handshake.
- providing Terraform with information about how to connect to the server.

## Implement Provider Interface

Any type that fills an
[interface](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/tfsdk#Provider)
can be a provider. We recommend that you define a `struct` type to fill this
interface.

The provider has four methods it needs to handle: `GetSchema`, `Configure`,
`GetResources`, and `GetDataSources`.

### GetSchema

`GetSchema` returns a
[schema](/plugin/framework/schemas) that describes the provider's
configuration block. This configuration block is used to offer practitioners
the opportunity to supply values to the provider and configure its behavior,
rather than needing to include those values in every resource and data source.
It is usually used to gather credentials, endpoints, and the other data used to
authenticate with the API, but it is not limited to those uses.

```tf
provider "example" {
  endpoint = "https://example.test/"
  api_token = "v3rYs3cr3tt0k3n"
}
```

Even if the provider does not want to accept practitioner configuration, it must return
an empty schema.

The schema is meant to be immutable. It should not change at runtime, and
should consistently return the same value.

### Configure

`Configure` handles and stores the
values the practitioner entered in the provider's configuration block. This
can mean creating the API client, storing the data on the type that
implements the provider interface, or otherwise handling the values. This is
the only time those values will be made available to the provider, so they
need to be persisted if the provider will need to reference them from within
a resource or data source. This is why we recommend using a struct
to represent the provider, as it can hold multiple values in a strongly-typed
way.

#### Unknown Values

Not all values are guaranteed to be
[known](/plugin/framework/types#unknown) when `Configure` is called.
For example, if a practitioner interpolates a resource's unknown value into the block,
that value may show up as unknown depending on how the graph executes:

```tf
resource "example_foo" "bar" {
  id = 123
}

provider "example" {
  endpoint = "https://example.test/"
  api_token = example_foo.bar.name
}
```

In the example above, `example_foo.bar.name` is a read-only field on
`example_foo.bar` that won't be set until after `example_foo.bar` has been
applied. So the `Configure` method for the provider may report that the value
is unknown. You can choose how your provider handles this. If
some resources or data sources can be used without knowing that value, it may
be worthwhile to [emit a warning](/plugin/framework/diagnostics) and
check whether the value is set in resources and data sources before attempting
to use it. If resources and data sources can't provide any functionality
without knowing that value, it's often better to [return an
error](/plugin/framework/diagnostics), which will halt the apply.

### GetResources

`GetResources` returns a map of [resource
types](/plugin/framework/resources). The keys of the
map entries must be the name of the resource as it would appear in the
configuration, including the provider prefix.

The list of resources is meant to be immutable. It should not change at
runtime, and should consistently return the same values.

### GetDataSources

`GetDataSources` returns a map of [data
source types](/plugin/framework/data-sources). The
keys of the map entries must be the name of the data source as it would appear
in the configuration, including the provider prefix.

The list of data sources is meant to be immutable. It should not change at
runtime, and should consistently return the same values.

## Further Provider Capabilities

- [Validation](/plugin/framework/validation) helps practitioners understand the required syntax, types, and acceptable values for your provider.
