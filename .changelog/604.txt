```release-note:note
all: For data handling consistency with attributes, unconfigured list and set blocks will now be represented as a null list or set instead of a known list or set with zero elements. This prevents confusing situations with validation and plan modification, where it was previously required to check block values for the number of elements. Logic that was previously missing null value checks for blocks may require updates.
```
