```

```release-note:breaking-change
types: The `Int64` type `Null`, `Unknown`, and `Value` fields have been removed. Use the `Int64Null()`, `Int64Unknown()`, and `Int64Value()` creation functions and `IsNull()`, `IsUnknown()`, and `ValueInt64()` methods instead.
```

```release-note:breaking-change

```

```release-note:enhancement
attr: Added `ValueState` type, which custom types can use to consistently represent the three possible value states (known, null, and unknown)
```

```release-note:bug
types: Prevented Terraform errors where the zero-value for any `attr.Value` types such as `String` would be a known value instead of null
```

```release-note:bug
types: Prevented indeterminate behavior for any `attr.Value` types where they could be any combination of null, unknown, and/or known
```
