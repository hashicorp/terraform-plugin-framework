# CRUD functions

In Terraform, a resource represents a single instance of a given resource type. They modify a specific resource in the
API and in Terraform's state through a set of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functions. A resource's CRUD
functions implement the logic required to manage your resources with Terraform. Refer to
[Resources - Define Resources](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources#define-resources) in the Framework documentation for details.

This page explains how to migrate a resource's CRUD functions from SDKv2 to the plugin Framework.

## SDKv2

In SDKv2, a resource's CRUD functions are defined by populating the relevant fields (e.g., `CreateContext`,
`ReadContext`) on the `schema.Resource` struct.

The following code shows a basic implementation of CRUD functions with SDKv2.

```go
func resourceExample() *schema.Resource {
    return &schema.Resource{
        CreateContext: create,
        ReadContext:   read,
        UpdateContext: update,
        DeleteContext: delete,
        /* ... */
```

## Framework
In the Framework, you implement CRUD functions for your resource by defining a type that implements the
`resource.Resource` interface. To define functions related to state upgrade, import, and plan modification,
implement their respective interfaces on your resource: `ResourceWithUpgradeState`, `ResourceWithImportState`, and
`ResourceWithModifyPlan`.

The following code shows how you define a `resource.Resource` which implements CRUD functions with the Framework.

```go
type resourceExample struct {
    p provider
}

func (r *resourceExample) Create(ctx context.Context, req resource.CreateRequest, resp
*resource.CreateResponse) {
    /* ... */
}

func (r *resourceExample) Read(ctx context.Context, req resource.ReadRequest, resp *resource.ReadResponse) {
    /* ... */
}

func (r *resourceExample) Update(ctx context.Context, req resource.UpdateRequest, resp *resource.UpdateResponse) {
    /* ... */
}

func (r *resourceExample) Delete(ctx context.Context, req resource.DeleteRequest, resp *resource.DeleteResponse) {
    /* ... */
}
```
## Migration Notes
Remember the following differences between SDKv2 and the Framework when completing the migration.

- In SDKv2 it is not necessary to define functions for parts of the CRUD lifecycle that are not used by a given
resource. For instance, if the resource does not support in-place modification, you do not need to define an `Update`
function. In the Framework, you must implement each of the CRUD lifecycle functions on all resources to satisfy the
`Resource` interface, even if the function does nothing.
- In SDKv2, the `Update` function (even if empty or missing) would automatically copy the request plan to the response state. This could be problematic when the `Update` function also returned errors as additional steps were required to disable the automatic SDKv2 behavior. In the Framework, the `Update` method must be written to explicitly copy data from `req.Plan` to `resp.State` to actually update the resource's state and prevent `Provider produced inconsistent result after apply` errors from Terraform.
- In SDKv2, calling `d.SetId("")` would signal resource removal. In the Framework, this is replaced with `resp.State.RemoveResource()`. Resource removal should only occur during the `Read` method to prevent `Provider produced inconsistent result after apply` errors from Terraform during other operations. The `Delete` method will automatically call `resp.State.RemoveResource()` if there are no errors.
- In SDKv2, you get and set attribute values in Terraform's state by calling `Get()` and `Set()` on
`schema.ResourceData`. In the Framework, you get attribute values from the configuration and plan by accessing
`Config` and `Plan` on `resource.CreateRequest`. You set attribute values in Terraform's state by mutating `State`
on `resource.CreateResponse`.
- In SDKv2, certain resource schema definition and data consistency errors are only visible as Terraform warning logs by default. After migration, these errors will always be visible to practitioners and prevent further Terraform operations. The [SDKv2 resource data consistency errors documentation](/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/data-consistency-errors) discusses how to find and potentially resolve these.

## Example

### SDKv2

The following example from shows implementations of CRUD functions on the with SDKv2.
The `UpdateContext` function is not implemented because the provider does not support updating this resource.

```go
func resourceExample() *schema.Resource {
    return &schema.Resource{
        CreateContext: create,
        ReadContext:   readNil,
        DeleteContext: RemoveResourceFromState,
        /* ... */
```

The following example shows the implementation of the `create()` function with SDKv2. The implementations of
the `readNil()` and `RemoveResourceFromState()` functions are not shown for brevity.

```go
func create(ctx context.Context, d *schema.ResourceData, meta interface{}) diag.Diagnostics {
    if err := d.Set("example_attribute", "value"); err != nil {
        diags = append(diags, diag.Errorf("err: %s", err)...)
        return diags
    }

    return nil
}
```

### Framework
The following shows the same section of provider code after the migration.

This code implements the `Create` function for the `example_resource` resource with the Framework.

```go
func (r *exampleResource) Create(ctx context.Context, req resource.CreateRequest, resp *resource.CreateResponse) {
    var plan exampleModel

    diags := req.Plan.Get(ctx, &plan)
    resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)
    if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
        return
    }

    plan.ExampleAttribute = types.StringValue("value")

    diags = resp.State.Set(ctx, plan)
    resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)
}
```
