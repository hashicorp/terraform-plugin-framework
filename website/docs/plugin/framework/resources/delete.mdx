# Delete resources

Deletion is part of the basic Terraform lifecycle for managing resources. During the [`terraform apply` command](/terraform/cli/commands/apply), Terraform calls the provider [`ApplyResourceChange`](/terraform/plugin/framework/internals/rpcs#applyresourcechange-rpc) RPC, in which the framework calls the [`resource.Resource` interface `Delete` method](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/resource#Resource.Delete). The request contains Terraform prior state data. The response is only for returning diagnostics. The data is defined by the [schema](/terraform/plugin/framework/schemas) of the resource.

Terraform 1.3 and later enables deletion planning, which resources can implement to return warning and error diagnostics. For additional information, refer to the [resource plan modification documentation](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/plan-modification#resource-destroy-plan-diagnostics).

Other resource lifecycle implementations include:

- [Create](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/create) resources by receiving Terraform configuration and plan data, performing creation logic, and saving Terraform state data.
- [Read](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/read) resources by receiving Terraform prior state data, performing read logic, and saving refreshed Terraform state data.
- [Update](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/update) resources in-place by receiving Terraform prior state, configuration, and plan data, performing update logic, and saving updated Terraform state data.

## Define Delete Method

Implement the `Delete` method by:

1. [Accessing prior state data](/terraform/plugin/framework/accessing-values) from the [`resource.DeleteRequest.State` field](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/resource#DeleteRequest.State).
1. Performing logic or external calls to destroy the resource.

If the logic needs to return [warning or error diagnostics](/terraform/plugin/framework/diagnostics), they can added into the [`resource.DeleteResponse.Diagnostics` field](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/resource#DeleteResponse.Diagnostics).

In this example, the `Delete` function makes a HTTP call and returns successfully if the status code was 200 OK or 404 Not Found:

```go
// ThingResource defines the resource implementation.
// Some resource.Resource interface methods are omitted for brevity.
type ThingResource struct {
	// client is configured via a Configure method, which is not shown in this
	// example for brevity. Refer to the Configure Resources documentation for
	// additional details for setting up resources with external clients.
	client *http.Client
}

// ThingResourceModel describes the Terraform resource data model to match the
// resource schema.
type ThingResourceModel struct {
	Name types.String `tfsdk:"name"`
	Id   types.String `tfsdk:"id"`
}

// ThingResourceAPIModel describes the API data model.
type ThingResourceAPIModel struct {
	Name string `json:"name"`
	Id   string `json:"id"`
}

func (r ThingResource) Schema(ctx context.Context, req resource.SchemaRequest, resp *resource.SchemaResponse) {
	resp.Schema = schema.Schema{
		Attributes: map[string]schema.Attribute{
			"name": schema.StringAttribute{
				MarkdownDescription: "Name of the thing to be saved in the service.",
				Required:            true,
			},
			"id": schema.StringAttribute{
				Computed:            true,
				MarkdownDescription: "Service generated identifier for the thing.",
				PlanModifiers: []planmodifier.String{
					stringplanmodifier.UseStateForUnknown(),
				},
			},
		},
		MarkdownDescription: "Manages a thing.",
	}
}

func (r ThingResource) Delete(ctx context.Context, req resource.DeleteRequest, resp *resource.DeleteResponse) {
	var data ThingResourceModel

	// Read Terraform prior state data into the model
	resp.Diagnostics.Append(req.State.Get(ctx, &data)...)

	// Convert from Terraform data model into API data model
	readReq := ThingResourceAPIModel{
		Id:   data.Id.ValueString(),
		Name: data.Name.ValueString(),
	}

	httpReqBody, err := json.Marshal(readReq)

	if err != nil {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Unable to Delete Resource",
			"An unexpected error occurred while creating the resource d request. "+
				"Please report this issue to the provider developers.\n\n"+
				"JSON Error: "+err.Error(),
		)

		return
	}

	// Create HTTP request
	httpReq := http.NewRequestWithContext(
		ctx,
		http.MethodDelete,
		"http://example.com/things",
		bytes.NewBuffer(httpReqBody),
	)

	// Send HTTP request
	httpResp, err := d.client.Do(httpReq)
	defer httpResp.Body.Close()

	if err != nil {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Unable to Delete Resource",
			"An unexpected error occurred while attempting to delete the resource. "+
				"Please retry the operation or report this issue to the provider developers.\n\n"+
				"HTTP Error: "+err.Error(),
		)

		return
	}

	// Return error if the HTTP status code is not 200 OK or 404 Not Found
	if httpResp.StatusCode != http.StatusNotFound && httpResp.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		resp.Diagnostics.AddError(
			"Unable to Delete Resource",
			"An unexpected error occurred while attempting to delete the resource. "+
				"Please retry the operation or report this issue to the provider developers.\n\n"+
				"HTTP Status: "+httpResp.Status,
		)

		return
	}

	// If the logic reaches here, it implicitly succeeded and will remove
	// the resource from state if there are no other errors.
}
```

## Caveats

Note these caveats when implementing the `Delete` method:

* An error is returned if the response state is set to anything other than null.
* Any response errors will cause Terraform to keep the resource under management.

## Recommendations

Note these recommendations when implementing the `Delete` method:

* Ignore errors that signify the resource is no longer existent.
* Skip calling the response state `RemoveResource()` method. The framework automatically handles this logic with the response state if there are no error diagnostics.
