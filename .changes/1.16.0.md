## 1.16.0 (September 17, 2025)

NOTES:

* all: This Go module has been updated to Go 1.24 per the [Go support policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy). It is recommended to review the [Go 1.24 release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.24) before upgrading. Any consumers building on earlier Go versions may experience errors. ([#1217](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1217))
* Support for the new `action{}` block is in technical preview and offered without compatibility promises until Terraform 1.14 is generally available. ([#1181](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1181))
* action: This release contains a new interface (`action.Action`) and packages for implementing action types, available in Terraform 1.14+. An action in Terraform can be defined by providers to model side-effects that practitioners can reference in their configurations via the `lifecycle.action_trigger` block. ([#1181](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1181))
* List support is in technical preview and offered without compatibility promises until Terraform 1.14 is generally available. ([#1150](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1150))
* list: This release contains a new interface (`list.ListResource`) and packages for implementing list resource types, available in Terraform 1.14+. A list resource in Terraform can be defined by providers to list remote resources within a given scope. ([#1150](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1150))

FEATURES:

* action: New package for implementing actions. ([#1181](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1181))
* action/schema: New package for implementing action schemas. ([#1183](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1183))
* types: Exported a previously internal function, `TerraformTypeToFrameworkType`, which converts `tftypes.Type` to a known framework type. ([#1200](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1200))
* list: New package for implementing list resources. ([#1150](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1150))
* all: Update Framework to handle new ListResource RPCs. ([#1157](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1157))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* provider: Added `ProviderWithActions` interface for implementing actions. ([#1181](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1181))
* provider: Added `ActionData` to `ConfigureResponse`, to pass provider-defined data to `action.Action` implementations. ([#1185](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1185))
* provider: Added `ListResourceData` to `ConfigureResponse`, to pass provider-defined data to `list.ListResource` implementations. ([#1202](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1202))
* tfsdk: Allow `SetAtPath` to be called with a `tftypes.Value`. ([#1198](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1198))
* tfsdk: Allow `SetAttribute` to be called with a `tftypes.Value`. ([#1205](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1205))
* list: Add the `ListResourceWithRawV5Schemas` and `ListResourceWithRawV6Schemas` interfaces to support list implementation on non-framework resources. ([#1198](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1198))
