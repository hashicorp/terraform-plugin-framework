# Blocks

A block is a container for other content:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "abc123"

  network_interface {
    # ...
  }
}
```

A block has a type (resource in this example). Each block type defines how many labels must follow the type keyword. The resource block type expects two labels, which are aws_instance and example in the example above. A particular block type may have any number of required labels, or it may require none as with the nested network_interface block type.

After the block type keyword and any labels, the block body is delimited by the { and } characters. Within the block body, further arguments and blocks may be nested, creating a hierarchy of blocks and their associated arguments.

The Terraform language uses a limited number of top-level block types, which are blocks that can appear outside of any other block in a configuration file. Most of Terraform's features (including resources, input variables, output values, data sources, etc.) are implemented as top-level blocks.

## List, Set and Single Nested Blocks

Wherever possible, the usage of [nested attributes](/plugin/framework/handling-data/terraform-concepts#nested-attributes) is preferred.

The three options for [nested blocks](/plugin/framework/handling-data/terraform-concepts#nested-blocks) are `ListNestedBlock`, `SetNestedBlock` and `SingleNestedBlock`.
