# CRUD functions

In Terraform, a resource represents a single instance of a given resource type. They modify a specific resource in the
API and in Terraform's state through a set of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functions. A resource's CRUD
functions implement the logic required to manage your resources with Terraform. Refer to
[Resources - Define Resources](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources#define-resources) in the Framework documentation for details.

This page explains how to migrate a resource's CRUD functions from SDKv2 to the plugin Framework.

## SDKv2

In SDKv2, a resource's CRUD functions are defined by populating the relevant fields (e.g., `CreateContext`,
`ReadContext`) on the `schema.Resource` struct.

The following code shows a basic implementation of CRUD functions with SDKv2.

```go
func resourceExample() *schema.Resource {
    return &schema.Resource{
        CreateContext: create,
        ReadContext:   read,
        UpdateContext: update,
        DeleteContext: delete,
        /* ... */
```

## Framework
In the Framework, you implement CRUD functions for your resource by defining a type that implements the
`resource.Resource` interface. To define functions related to state upgrade, import, and plan modification,
implement their respective interfaces on your resource: `ResourceWithUpgradeState`, `ResourceWithImportState`, and
`ResourceWithModifyPlan`.

The following code shows how you define a `resource.Resource` which implements CRUD functions with the Framework.

```go
type resourceExample struct {
    p provider
}

func (r *resourceExample) Create(ctx context.Context, req resource.CreateRequest, resp
*resource.CreateResponse) {
    /* ... */
}

func (r *resourceExample) Read(ctx context.Context, req resource.ReadRequest, resp *resource.ReadResponse) {
    /* ... */
}

func (r *resourceExample) Update(ctx context.Context, req resource.UpdateRequest, resp *resource.UpdateResponse) {
    /* ... */
}

func (r *resourceExample) Delete(ctx context.Context, req resource.DeleteRequest, resp *resource.DeleteResponse) {
    /* ... */
}
```
## Migration Notes
Remember the following differences between SDKv2 and the Framework when completing the migration.

- In SDKv2 it is not necessary to define functions for parts of the CRUD lifecycle that are not used by a given
resource. For instance, if the resource does not support in-place modification, you do not need to define an `Update`
function. In the Framework, you must implement each of the CRUD lifecycle functions on all resources to satisfy the
`Resource` interface, even if the function does nothing.
- In SDKv2, the `Update` function (even if empty or missing) would automatically copy the request plan to the response state. This could be problematic when the `Update` function also returned errors as additional steps were required to disable the automatic SDKv2 behavior. In the Framework, the `Update` method must be written to explicitly copy data from `req.Plan` to `resp.State` to actually update the resource's state and prevent `Provider produced inconsistent result after apply` errors from Terraform.
- In SDKv2, calling `d.SetId("")` would signal resource removal. In the Framework, this is replaced with `resp.State.RemoveResource()`. Resource removal should only occur during the `Read` method to prevent `Provider produced inconsistent result after apply` errors from Terraform during other operations. The `Delete` method will automatically call `resp.State.RemoveResource()` if there are no errors.
- In SDKv2, you get and set attribute values in Terraform's state by calling `Get()` and `Set()` on
`schema.ResourceData`. In the Framework, you get attribute values from the configuration and plan by accessing
`Config` and `Plan` on `resource.CreateRequest`. You set attribute values in Terraform's state by mutating `State`
on `resource.CreateResponse`.

## Example

### SDKv2

The following example from shows implementations of CRUD functions on the with SDKv2.
The `UpdateContext` function is not implemented because the provider does not support updating this resource.

```go
func resourceExample() *schema.Resource {
    return &schema.Resource{
        CreateContext: create,
        ReadContext:   readNil,
        DeleteContext: RemoveResourceFromState,
        /* ... */
```

The following example shows the implementation of the `create()` function with SDKv2. The implementations of
the `readNil()` and `RemoveResourceFromState()` functions are not shown for brevity.

```go
func create(ctx context.Context, d *schema.ResourceData, meta interface{}) diag.Diagnostics {
    if err := d.Set("example_attribute", "value"); err != nil {
        diags = append(diags, diag.Errorf("err: %s", err)...)
        return diags
    }

    return nil
}
```

### Framework
The following shows the same section of provider code after the migration.

This code implements the `Create` function for the `example_resource` resource with the Framework.

```go
func (r *exampleResource) Create(ctx context.Context, req resource.CreateRequest, resp *resource.CreateResponse) {
    var plan exampleModel

    diags := req.Plan.Get(ctx, &plan)
    resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)
    if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
        return
    }

    plan.ExampleAttribute = types.StringValue("value")

    diags = resp.State.Set(ctx, plan)
    resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)
}
```
