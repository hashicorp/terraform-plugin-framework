package schema

// Schema is used to define the shape of practitioner-provider information,
// like resources, data sources, and providers. Think of it as a type
// definition, but for Terraform.
type Schema struct {
	// Attributes are the fields inside the resource, provider, or data
	// source that the schema is defining. The map key should be the name
	// of the attribute, and the body defines how it behaves. Names must
	// only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
	Attributes map[string]Attribute

	// Version indicates the current version of the schema. Schemas are
	// versioned to help with automatic upgrade process. This is not
	// typically required unless there is a change in the schema, such as
	// changing an attribute type, that needs manual upgrade handling.
	// Versions should only be incremented by one each release.
	Version int64
