# Conversion Rules

## Converting from Framework Types to Go Types

!> **Warning:** It can be tempting to use Go types instead of `attr.Value`
implementations when the provider doesn't care about the distinction between an
empty value, unknown, and null. But if Terraform has a null or unknown value
and the provider asks the framework to store it in a type that can't hold it,
[`Get`](/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/accessing-values#get-the-entire-configuration-plan-or-state)
will return an error. Make sure the types you are using can hold the
values they might contain!

### String

Strings can be automatically converted to Go's `string` type (or any aliases of
it, like `type MyString string`) as long as the string value is not null or
unknown.

### Number

Numbers can be automatically converted to the following numeric types (or any
aliases of them, like `type MyNumber int`) as long as the number value is not
null or unknown:

* `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
* `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
* `float32`, `float64`
* [`*big.Int`](https://pkg.go.dev/math/big#Int), [`*big.Float`](https://pkg.go.dev/math/big#Float)

An error will be returned if the value of the number cannot be stored in the numeric type supplied because of an overflow or other loss of precision.

### Boolean

Booleans can be automatically converted to Go's `bool` type (or any aliases of
it, like `type MyBoolean bool`) as long as the boolean value is not null or
unknown.

### List

Lists can be automatically converted to any Go slice type (or alias of a Go
slice type, like `type MyList []string`), with the elements either being
`attr.Value` implementations or being converted according to these rules. Go
slice types are considered capable of handling null values; the slice will be
set to nil. The `Get` method will still return an error for unknown list
values.

### Map

Maps can be automatically converted to any Go map type with string keys (or any
alias of a Go map type with string keys, like `type MyMap map[string]int`),
with the elements either being `attr.Value` implementations or being converted
according to these rules. Go map types are considered capable of handling null
values; the map will be set to nil. The `Get` method will still return an error
for unknown map values.

### Object

Objects can be automatically converted to any Go struct type with that follows these constraints:

* Every property on the struct must have a `tfsdk` struct tag.
* The `tfsdk` struct tag must name an attribute in the object that it is being
  mapped to or be set to `-` to explicitly declare it does not map to an
  attribute in the object.
* Every attribute in the object must have a corresponding struct tag.

These rules help prevent typos and human error from unwittingly discarding
information by failing as early, consistently, and loudly as possible.

Properties can either be `attr.Value` implementations or will be converted
according to these rules.

Unknown and null objects cannot be represented as structs and will return an
error. Their attributes may contain unknown or null values if the attribute's
type can hold them.

### Pointers

Pointers behave exactly like the type they are referencing, except they can hold
null values. A pointer will be set to `nil` when representing a null value;
otherwise, the conversion rules for that type will apply.

### Detected Interfaces

[`Get`](/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/accessing-values#get-the-entire-configuration-plan-or-state)
detects and utilizes the following interfaces, if the target implements
them.

#### ValueConverter

If a value is being set on a Go type that implements the [`tftypes.ValueConverter`
interface](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go/tftypes#ValueConverter),
that interface will be delegated to to handle the conversion.

#### Unknownable

If the value is being set on a Go type that fills the `Unknownable` interface:

```go
type Unknownable interface {
	SetUnknown(context.Context, bool) error
	SetValue(context.Context, interface{}) error
	GetUnknown(context.Context) bool
	GetValue(context.Context) interface{}
}
```

It will be considered capable of handling unknown values, and those methods
will be used to populate it and retrieve its value. The `interface{}` being
passed and retrieved will be of a type that can be passed to
[`tftypes.NewValue`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go/tftypes#NewValue).

#### Nullable

If the value is being set on a Go type that fills the `Nullable` interface:

```go
type Nullable interface {
	SetNull(context.Context, bool) error
	SetValue(context.Context, interface{}) error
	GetNull(context.Context) bool
	GetValue(context.Context) interface{}
}
```

It will be considered capable of handling null values, and those methods will
be used to populate it and retrieve its value. The `interface{}` being passed
and retrieved will be of a type that can be passed to
[`tftypes.NewValue`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go/tftypes#NewValue).

## Converting from Go Types to Framework Types

The following is a list of schema types and the Go types they know how to
accept in [`Set`](/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/writing-state#replace-the-entire-state)
and [`SetAttribute`](/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/writing-state#set-a-single-attribute-or-block-value).

### String

Strings can be automatically created from Go's `string` type (or any aliases of
it, like `type MyString string`).

### Number

Numbers can be automatically created from the following numeric types (or any
aliases of them, like `type MyNumber int`):

* `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
* `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
* `float32`, `float64`
* [`*big.Int`](https://pkg.go.dev/math/big#Int), [`*big.Float`](https://pkg.go.dev/math/big#Float)

### Boolean

Booleans can be automatically created from Go's `bool` type (or any aliases of
it, like `type MyBoolean bool`).

### List

Lists can be automatically created from any Go slice type (or alias of a Go
slice type, like `type MyList []string`), with the elements either being
`attr.Value` implementations or being converted according to these rules.

### Map

Maps can be automatically created from any Go map type with string keys (or any
alias of a Go map type with string keys, like `type MyMap map[string]int`),
with the elements either being `attr.Value` implementations or being converted
according to these rules.

### Object

Objects can be automatically created from any Go struct type with that follows
these constraints:

* Every property on the struct must have a `tfsdk` struct tag.
* The `tfsdk` struct tag must name an attribute in the object that it is being
mapped to or be set to `-` to explicitly declare it does not map to an
attribute in the object.
* Every attribute in the object must have a corresponding struct tag.

These rules help prevent typos and human error from unwittingly discarding
information by failing as early, consistently, and loudly as possible.

Properties can either be `attr.Value` implementations or will be converted
according to these rules.

### Pointers

A nil pointer will be treated as a null value. Otherwise, the rules for the
type the pointer is referencing apply.

### Detected Interfaces

`Set` detects and utilizes the following interfaces, if the target implements
them.

#### ValueCreator

If a value is set on a Go type that implements the [`tftypes.ValueCreator`
interface](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go/tftypes#ValueCreator),
that interface will be delegated to to handle the conversion.

#### Unknownable

If a value is set on a Go type that fills the `Unknownable` interface:

```go
type Unknownable interface {
	SetUnknown(context.Context, bool) error
	SetValue(context.Context, interface{}) error
	GetUnknown(context.Context) bool
	GetValue(context.Context) interface{}
}
```

It will be used to convert the value. The `interface{}` being passed and
retrieved will be of a type that can be passed to
[`tftypes.NewValue`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go/tftypes#NewValue).

#### Nullable

If a value is set on a Go type that fills the `Nullable` interface:

```go
type Nullable interface {
	SetNull(context.Context, bool) error
	SetValue(context.Context, interface{}) error
	GetNull(context.Context) bool
	GetValue(context.Context) interface{}
}
```

It will be used to convert the value. The `interface{}` being passed and
retrieved will be of a type that can be passed to
[`tftypes.NewValue`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go/tftypes#NewValue).
