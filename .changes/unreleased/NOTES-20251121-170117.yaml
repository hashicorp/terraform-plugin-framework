kind: NOTES
body: 'In `terraform-plugin-framework@v1.15.1`, the `UseStateForUnknown` plan modifier was updated to preserve null values from prior state
    for unconfigured attributes. This updated version can cause plan inconsistency errors when used on child attributes of a nested attribute
    that expect `UseStateForUnknown` to keep the child attributes on new nested objects as `<unknown>` (known after apply).

    The new `UseNonNullStateForUnknown` plan modifier can now be used where child attributes are expecting this pre-1.15.1 behavior.'
