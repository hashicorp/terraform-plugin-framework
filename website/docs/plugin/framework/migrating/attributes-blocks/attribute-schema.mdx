# Attribute Schema

-> Note: The Plugin Framework is in beta.

Attributes define how users can configure values for your Terraform provider, resources, and data sources. Refer to
[Schemas - Attributes](/plugin/framework/schemas#attributes) in the Framework documentation for details.

This page explains how to migrate an attribute from SDKv2 to the plugin Framework.

## SDKv2
In SDKv2, attributes are defined by the `Schema` field in the provider, resource, or data source schema. The `Schema`
field maps each attribute name (string) to the attribute's `schema.Schema` struct. Both resources and data sources are
defined using the `schema.Resource` struct.

The following code shows a basic implementation of attribute schema for a provider in SDKv2.

```go
func ProviderExample() *schema.Provider {
    return &schema.Provider{
        Schema: map[string]*schema.Schema{
            /* ... */
},
```

In SDKv2, resource and data source attributes are defined the same way on their respective types.

```go
func resourceExample() *schema.Resource {
    return &schema.Resource{
        Schema: map[string]*schema.Schema{
            /* ... */
```
## Framework

In the Framework, you define attributes by setting the `Attributes` field on your provider, resource, or data type's
schema, as returned by the `GetSchema` function. The `tfsdk.Schema` type returned by `GetSchema` includes an
`Attributes` field that maps each attribute name (string) to the attribute's `tfsdk.Attribute` struct.

The following code shows how to define an attribute for a resource with the Framework.

```go
func (d *resourceTypeExample) GetSchema(context.Context) (tfsdk.Schema, diag.Diagnostics) {
    return tfsdk.Schema{
        Attributes: map[string]tfsdk.Attribute{
            "example": {
                /* ... */
```

The Framework defines the `tfsdk.Attribute` struct as follows.

```go
type Attribute struct {
    Type                attr.Type
    Attributes          NestedAttributes
    Description         string
    MarkdownDescription string
    Required            bool
    Optional            bool
    Computed            bool
    Sensitive           bool
    DeprecationMessage  string
    Validators          []AttributeValidator
    PlanModifiers       AttributePlanModifiers
}
```
## Migration Notes
Remember the following differences between SDKv2 and the Framework when completing the migration.

- In SDKv2, attributes are defined by a map from attribute names to `schema.Schema` structs in the `Schema` field of
your resource's schema. In the Framework, attributes are defined by a map from attribute names to `tfsdk.Attribute`
structs in your resource's schema, which is returned by the `GetSchema` function.
- There are several differences between the implementation of attributes in SDKv2 and the Framework. Refer to the other
pages in the Attributes & Blocks section of this migration guide for more details.

## Example

The following examples show how to migrate portions of the
[http](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-http) provider.

For a complete example, clone the
`terraform-provider-http` repository and compare the `data_source.go` file in
[v2.2.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-http/blob/v2.2.0/internal/provider/data_source.go)
with the `data_source_http.go` file
[after the migration](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-http/blob/8527d5b4546b54cdef246a13befc5745dbbbf740/internal/provider/data_source_http.go).


### SDKv2

The following example from the `data_source.go` file shows the implementation of the `url` attribute for the `http`
data source.

```go
func dataSource() *schema.Resource {
    return &schema.Resource{
        /* ... */
        Schema: map[string]*schema.Schema{
            "url": {
                Description: "The URL for the request. Supported schemes are `http` and `https`.",
                Type:        schema.TypeString,
                Required:    true,
            },
```


### Framework

The following shows the same section of provider code after the migration.

This code implements the `url` attribute for the `http` data source with the Framework.

```go
func (d *httpDataSource) GetSchema(context.Context) (tfsdk.Schema, diag.Diagnostics) {
    return tfsdk.Schema{
        /* ... */
        Attributes: map[string]tfsdk.Attribute{
            "url": {
                Description: "The URL for the request. Supported schemes are `http` and `https`.",
                Type:        types.StringType,
                Required:    true,
            },
            /* ... */
```
