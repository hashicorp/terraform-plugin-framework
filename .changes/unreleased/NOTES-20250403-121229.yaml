kind: NOTES
body: This beta pre-release continues the implementation of managed resource identity, which should now be used with Terraform v1.12.0-beta1.
    Managed resources now can support import by identity during plan and apply workflows. Managed resources that already support import via the
    `resource.ResourceWithImportState` interface will automatically pass-through identity data to the `Read` method. The `RequiredForImport` and
    `OptionalForImport` fields on the identity schema can be used to control the validation that Terraform core will apply to the import config block.
