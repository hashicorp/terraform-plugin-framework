```release-note:note
tfsdk: The `NewProtocol6Server()` function has been deprecated in preference of `providerserver.NewProtocol6()` and `providerserver.NewProtocol6WithError()` functions, which will simplify muxing and testing implementations. The `tfsdk.NewProtocol6Server()` function will be removed in the next minor version.
```

```release-note:note
tfsdk: The `Serve()` function has been deprecated in preference of the `providerserver.Serve()` function. The `tfsdk.Serve()` function will be removed in the next minor version.
```

```release-note:note
tfsdk: The `ServeOpts` type has been deprecated in preference of the `providerserver.ServeOpts` type. When migrating, the `Name` field has been replaced with `Address`. The `tfsdk.ServeOpts` type will be removed in the next minor version.
```

```release-note:note
tfsdk: The previously unexported `server` type has been temporarily exported to aid in the migration to the new `providerserver` package. It is not intended for provider developer usage and will be moved into an internal package in the next minor version.
```

```release-note:feature
Introduced `providerserver` package, which contains all functions and types necessary for serving a provider in production or acceptance testing.
```
