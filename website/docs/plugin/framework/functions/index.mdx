# Functions

<Highlight>

Provider-defined function support is in technical preview and offered without compatibility promises until Terraform 1.8 is generally available.

</Highlight>

Functions are an abstraction that allow providers to expose computational logic beyond Terraform's [built-in functions](/terraform/language/functions) and simplify practitioner configurations. Provider-defined functions are supported in Terraform 1.8 and later.

## Concepts

Learn about Terraform's [concepts](/terraform/plugin/framework/functions/concepts) for provider-defined functions, such as intended purpose, example use cases, and terminology. The framework's implementation details, such as naming, are based on these concepts.

## Implementation

Learn about how to [implement code](/terraform/plugin/framework/functions/implementation) for a provider-defined function in the framework.

## Testing

Learn about how to ensure a provider-defined function implementation works as expected via [unit testing and acceptance testing](/terraform/plugin/framework/functions/testing).

## Documentation

Learn about how to [document](/terraform/plugin/framework/functions/documentation) a provider-defined function implementation so practitioners can discover and use the function.
